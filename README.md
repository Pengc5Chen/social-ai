# social-ai

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page reloads when you make changes and you may see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. React is bundled in production mode and optimized for the best performance. The build is minified and filenames include hashes.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!** All configuration files (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) will be copied into the project for full control.
